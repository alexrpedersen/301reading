#  SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## Responsive Web Design

#### Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

## Floats

#### Floats create alternate flows. This is the hardest part to understand. And once you introduce them, you then need to write your code so that it accounts for up to three flows: normal, left and right. This is a whole new set of rules, as opposed to manipulating the width of elements or their positioning.

## SMACSS

####  There is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process.
