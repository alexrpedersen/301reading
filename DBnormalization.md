# DataBAse Normalization
## The Basics
#### There are three main reasons to normalize a database.  The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries. 
#### First Normal Form – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
#### Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
#### Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
