# Node.Js

### Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

#### Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database. 

### MVC

#### We can describe the MVC architecture in simple terms:

#### Model: the part of our application that will deal with the database or any data-related functionality.
#### View: everything the user will see — basically, the pages that we’re going to send to the client.
#### Controller: the logic of our site, and the glue between models and views. Here we call our models to get the data, then we put that data on our views to be sent to the users.
