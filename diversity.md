### Diversity In our community

#### The diversity that we see in our industry is substantially more than any other in the world. The inclusion that we have seen from gender to race to religion, the industry is evolving in a way that is fantastic. We encourage this.

#### Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. 

#### Diverse teams are smarter and more effective. 

#### Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.

#### Companies want to innovate. By being diverse it helps expand in ways that benefit the community and the company.
